            <h3 class="title">About amiibo figures</h3>
            <p>Amiibo (officially stylized as amiibo; plural: Amiibo) is a toys-to-life platform by Nintendo,
                which was launched in November 2014. It consists of a wireless communications and storage protocol for
                connecting figurines to the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch video game consoles. These
                figurines are similar in form and functionality to that of the Skylanders, Disney Infinity and Lego
                Dimensions series of toys-to-life platforms. The Amiibo platform was preannounced to potentially
                accommodate any form of toy, specifically including general plans for future card games. These
                toys use near field communication (NFC) to interact with supported video game software, potentially
                allowing data to be transferred in and out of games and across multiple platforms.

                Amiibo functionality can be used directly with the Nintendo Switch, Wii U, and New Nintendo 3DS consoles
                by using built-in NFC readers. In addition, the rest of the 3DS hardware line can use an official NFC
                adapter. By September 2016, Nintendo reported that 39 million Amiibo toys had been sold, along with more
                than 30 million Amiibo cards.</p>
